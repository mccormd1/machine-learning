    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

The strengths are that is doesn't require a training process and can deal with non-linearity. The weaknesses are that you are required to store all the datapoints in order to make decisions, prediction can take a long time, and it requires there to be some relationship between similarity and closeness. This would be a potentially good candidate for this problem as there are likely a lot of similarities between people who make >50k and therefore would be potential donors.\n",

    "*Decision Trees:* An application for decision trees are great for decisions, like what restaurant to go to given various factors. One of the more underrated strengths of a Decision Tree is that it is easy comprehend and explain to someone without a statistical or machine learning background. Additionally, it handles feature interaction and feature selection. One of the weaknesses is that they may be non-robust, and changes in the training data may drastically change the tree architecture. Another is that without proper tuning the trees may tend to become overly complex. This is a good candidate for the problem because there are categories which likely are very predictive of income\n",
    "\n",
    "*Gaussian Naive Bayes:* An application for Gaussian Naive Bayes is spam classification. A strength of NB is that is can be individualized, in the case of spam classification. In general, it is very simple and performs really well in small data sets. A weakness is that is is not very complex and may be unable to define more complex decisions in larger datasets, as it doesn't allow for learning of interactions between features. This is a good candidate because often the simplest is best, but I am worried that there are features where meaningful interaction would be powerful in modeling the data."

It has both high accuracy as well as consistenly higher F-score on test data than naive classification as well as the other methods, meaning it has a well balanced ability to detect 50K+ individuals as well as reject \\<50K individuals.

    "**Answer: ** A Decision tree works by chaining a bunch of \"questions\" together to separate data. You start by asking the most powerful distinguishing questions, potentially like \"does this person have capital gains?\" and then a decision is made separating them into groups. As you go on, you ask more nuanced or specific questions, informed by the previous ones. In other words, the line of questioning may be different depending on which branch you go on. Ideally, at the end you have nicely separated groups of \"leaves\" at the end of the tree branches that can be grouped into your classification groups. The model is first trained on data paired with the labels, so the model can \"learn\" which questions are most powerful in separating people into the given groups, building the tree. Then, new data is subjected to the built tree to classify."

I can see how age is a dominant feature, because people generally get raises with experience, and the older you are the more opportunities you have for getting raises. My big miss is hours per week. I can see how this is important because people that work a lot of hours either make overtime hourly, likely have a well paying salary job, or may own their own business, which can affect income."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

If training time *was* a factor, using less features would definitely be something worth implementing, especially since it performs nearly as well as the fully featured model. It is worth noting that the top 5 features describes the data near as well as the full featured model, as shown by the accuracy and F-score less that ~5% lower than the full model. This is a strong consideration for slow train/predict models and should always be checked."
